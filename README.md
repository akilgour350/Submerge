# Submerge

## What is Submerge?
Submerge is a library, written in C# which deals with file handling, encoding and encryption. It is the successor to my previous library, Krypton, and there are a number of features planned.

## Current Features
- File handling, including reading and writing to files.
- Encoding using C#'s Encoding class.
- Encryption powered by C#'s AES class.
- Drowning, an extra security measure I developed.

## Documentation
Documentation for Submerge can be found on [my website.](https://akilgour350.github.io/documentation/submerge_documentation.html)

## Upcoming Features
- Combined Drowning and Encryption.
- Direct reading and writing encoded and encrypted files.
- Reading and writing Dictionaries (and equivalent) to files.
- Encryption utilising other algorithms.

## Licensing
Submerge is completely free to use. However, I do request that you give me, Alastair Kilgour, credit somewhere in your code. Thanks!
